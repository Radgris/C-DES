use bitwise operation to manipulate bits, these operation can be used with decimal numbers and will directly convert internally to bit operations
note: the operation that requires us to "cycle" bits is still pending, probably a custom function: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1768055
we also need a function that takes 2 array of bits ( not necesarrily an array structure) and shifts array A based on array's B content: (bit access)https://stackoverflow.com/a/9954810
